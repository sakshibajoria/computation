<p> "Don't slouch" or "sit straight" are phrases all of us have heard at some point in our lives. We all occassionally suffer from back pains and neck aches, especially because of the pandemic now. Even the little physical communication which was essential became littler, with work and education moving online and this definitely did not help. No, back pains are not just a sign of you aging and yes, you are not alone when it comes to feeling. They occur due to poor postures - most of which happen unknowingly when you're sitting, standing or lying down. </p>
