<h3>Creative Computing</h3>
<p> Knowing pretty much nothing about creative computing initially, I started off with the mindset of it being nothing but code. "Why does a graphic design student need to learn how to code?" I thought, looking at the robotic, coding font and then the Arduino kit. It didn't help when I was unsuccessful with my first ever attempt at lighting up an LED. However, after pushing myself to try and understand its basics through further <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0KErKHxHf0">YouTube tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE">TinkerCAD</a>, I managed to get through a few simulation projects and started understanding how computing could help with the creative industry in today's technological day and age. 
</p>
<p> Open-source projects like the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Experiments with Google</a> made me realise the wide scope of creative computing, the changes it can make in people's lives and how designers can collaborate and partipciate online together through it. </p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<blockquote> <em> You see it everywhere. In homes and offices, while walking down the street, riding the bus, or standing in line. “Tech neck,” the act of stressing muscles while using phones, tablets, and computers, resulting in neck and shoulder pain, stiffness, and soreness, is a problem that’s getting worse. (Riew, 2021) </em> </blockquote>
<p> <em>"Don't slouch!"</em> or <em>"Sit straight!"</em> are phrases all of us have heard at some point in our lives. We all occassionally suffer from back pains and neck aches, especially because of the pandemic now, as even the little physical communication in work and education which was essential moved online. This resulted in us sitting on our chairs, slouched. No, back pains are not just a sign of you aging and you are not alone when it comes to feeling that sharp pain when you stand up after a session. They occur due to poor postures, most of which happen unknowingly when you're sitting, standing or lying down.
</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p> With technology being able to solve every other difficulty we face nowadays, I think postures are something which can be better informed with the help of a sensor. I propose the idea of a product which would aim to urge the user to fix their posture every time they drooped forward. This small device, consisting of hardware with motion sensors, would be stuck on the user's back. It would send a notification or alert to the user's smartphone if it sensed their shoulders or shoulder muscles relaxing for a long time. This feature would also allow the user to check when or during which activity they slouched the most in a day, such as while:
<ul>
<li>walking</li>
<li>sitting in front of their laptop screens</li>
<li>lying down on their stomachs</li>
<li>bending forward in general while scrolling on Instagram</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Other Approaches</h3>
<p> I considered a few other ideas for the device such as a shoulder band, a band around the neck or attaching the device on the user's garment or undergarment. I went through ideas like adding the piezo in the Arduino circuit for emmitting a sound when the shoulder muscles relaxed - alerting the user to stand straight. This could also act, alternatively, as a device to help women's safety.
</p>
<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p> I want to develop the project by learning the required code in order to create the mobile app or design a website using Glitch, to showcase the product, as I was unable to do these in the week due to time and skill constraints. I would also like to look into how effectively the device would benefit the user and how I could develop its aesthetics and functionality. </p>
