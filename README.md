# A proposal: the Slouch Spotter
<p> "Don't slouch" or "sit straight" are phrases all of us have heard at some point in our lives. We all occassionally suffer from back pains and neck aches, especially because of the pandemic now. Even the little physical communication which was essential became littler, with work and education moving online and this definitely did not help. No, back pains are not just a sign of you aging and yes, you are not alone when it comes to feeling. They occur due to poor postures, most of which happen unknowingly when you're sitting, standing or lying down. And, most of the time it's when you're on your phone or laptop. </p>
<p> With technology being able to solve every other difficulty we face nowadays, postures are something which can be better informed with a sensor. I propose the idea of a product which would aim to urge the user to fix their posture every time they drooped forward. This small device, consisting of hardware with motion sensors, would be stuck on the user's back. It would send a notification or alert to the user's smartphone if it sensed their shoulders or shoulder muscles relaxing for a long time. This feature would also allow the user to check when or during which activity they slouched the most in the day, such as while:
  - walking
  - sitting in front of their laptops
  - lying down on their stomachs
