# A proposal
<h3>Creative Computing</h3>
<p> Knowing pretty much nothing about creative computing initially, I started off with the mindset of it being nothing but code. <em> "Why does a graphic design student need to learn how to code?" </em> I thought, looking at the robotic, coding font and then the Arduino kit. It didn't help when I was unsuccessful with my first ever attempt at lighting up an LED. However, after pushing myself to try and understand its basics through further <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0KErKHxHf0">YouTube tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE">TinkerCAD</a>, I managed to get through a few simulation projects and started understanding how computing could help with the creative industry in today's ever-evolving technological day and age. </p>
<h3>My second attempt at lighting up an LED with an Arduino board</h3>

<h3>Lighting multiple LEDs on TinkerCAD</h3>

<h3>Open-Source</h3>
<p> Open-source projects like the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Experiments with Google</a> made me realise the wide scope of creative computing, the changes it can make in people's lives today and how designers can collaborate and partipciate online through it. This led me to think about problems in our daily lives from women's safety to poor postures and how digital technology could solve them. </p> 
<h2>Proposal for a product/app</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<blockquote> <em> You see it everywhere. In homes and offices, while walking down the street, riding the bus, or standing in line. <strong>"Tech Neck,"</strong> the act of stressing muscles while using phones, tablets, and computers, resulting in neck and shoulder pain, stiffness, and soreness, is a problem thatâ€™s getting worse. (Riew, 2021) </em> </blockquote>
<p> <em>"Don't slouch!"</em> or <em>"Sit straight!"</em> are phrases all of us have heard at some point in our lives. We all occassionally suffer from <strong>back pains</strong> and <strong>neck aches</strong>, especially because of the pandemic now, as even the little physical communication in work and education which was essential, moved online. This resulted in us sitting on our chairs, slouched for hours in online classes. No, back pains are not just a sign of you aging and you're not alone when it comes to feeling that sharp lower back pain when you stand up after a while. They occur due to <strong>poor postures</strong>, most of which happen unknowingly.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p> With technology being able to solve every other difficulty we face nowadays, I think postures are something which can be better informed with the help of a <strong>sensor</strong>. I propose the idea of a product which would urge the user to fix their posture every time they drooped forward. This small device, consisting of hardware with PIR motion sensors, would be stuck on the user's back. It would send a <strong>notification</strong> or alert to the user's smartphone if it sensed their shoulders or shoulder muscles relaxing for a long time. The notification would be <strong>colour-coded</strong> with the light of the LED on the Aduino, with red signifying an extremely poor posture. This feature would also allow the user to check when or during which activity they slouched the most in a day, such as while:
<ul>
<li>walking</li>
<li>sitting in front of their laptop screens</li>
<li>lying down on their stomachs</li>
<li>drooping or bending forward while scrolling on Instagram</li>
</ul> </p>
<h3>Hardware with PIR Motion Sensor</h3>

The sensor would light up the LED based on how much the back muscles relax. Testing would clear out any uncertainties about whether this would work effectively with multiple LEDs.

<h3>Other Approaches</h3>
<p> I considered a few other ideas for the device such as a shoulder band, a band around the neck or attaching the device on the user's garment or undergarment. I went through ideas like adding the piezo in the Arduino for emmitting a sound when the shoulder muscles relaxed - alerting the user to stand straight. This could also act, alternatively, as a device to help women's safety by generating a loud sound when in danger.</p>
<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p> I want to develop the project by learning the required code in order to create the mobile app or design a website using Glitch, to showcase the product, as I was unable to do so in the week due to time and skill constraints. I need to think about how the device could be worn comfortably, without it showing very visibly and prototypes of the potential device and app. I would also like to look into how effectively the device would benefit the user and about its aesthetics and functionality. </p>
