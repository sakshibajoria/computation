# A proposal: The Slouch Spotter
<h3>The Problem</h3>
> You see it everywhere. In homes and offices, while walking down the street, riding the bus, or standing in line. “Tech neck,” the act of stressing muscles while using phones, tablets, and computers, resulting in neck and shoulder pain, stiffness, and soreness, is a problem that’s getting worse.
<p> > You see it everywhere. In homes and offices, while walking down the street, riding the bus, or standing in line. “Tech neck,” the act of stressing muscles while using phones, tablets, and computers, resulting in neck and shoulder pain, stiffness, and soreness, is a problem that’s getting worse. <em>"Don't slouch!"</em> or <em>"Sit straight!"</em> are phrases all of us have heard at some point in our lives. We all occassionally suffer from back pains and neck aches, especially because of the pandemic now, as even the little physical communication which was essential, such as work and education moved online and this definitely did not help our lifestyles. No, back pains are not just a sign of you aging and you are not alone when it comes to feeling that shar. They occur due to poor postures, most of which happen unknowingly when you're sitting, standing or lying down. Of course, most of the time it's when you're on your phone or laptop. </p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p> With technology being able to solve every other difficulty we face nowadays, I think postures are something which can be better informed with the help of a sensor. I propose the idea of a product which would aim to urge the user to fix their posture every time they drooped forward. This small device, consisting of hardware with motion sensors, would be stuck on the user's back. It would send a notification or alert to the user's smartphone if it sensed their shoulders or shoulder muscles relaxing for a long time. This feature would also allow the user to check when or during which activity they slouched the most in a day, such as while:
 <ul>
  <li>walking</li>
  <li>sitting in front of their laptop screens</li>
  <li>lying down on their stomachs</li>
  <li>bending forward in general while scrolling on Instagram</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Other Approaches</h3>
<p> 
</p> I considered a few other ideas for the device such as a shoulder band, a band around the neck or attaching the device on the user's garment or undergarment.
